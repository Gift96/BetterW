# BetterW
  
BetterW is a Mobile Substrate Tweak made with Theos (see https://github.com/theos/theos) that provides a few utilities to whatsapp, improving the user experience.  

## Currently Available Features
Currently, BetterW provides 2 (two) options of additional features to use:  
1 - No Read Receipt, that prevents others from seeing when you read a message, but still allowing you to see when others read yours.  
2 - Who Is Online (BETA), that allows you to see who is online, drawing a green or red circle around their profile picture.  
3 - Confirm Call, that asks you to confirm your desire to call another user, preventing accidental voice / video calls.  
4 - Don't Delete (BETA), will make so that when someone deletes a message, it does not delete in your device, adding a alert at the top of the message, alerting that the message was saved from oblivion. There is a know issue where sometimes another message can overlap the deleted one, until the app is restarted.
