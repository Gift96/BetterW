# BetterW
  
BetterW is a Mobile Substrate Tweak made with Theos (see https://github.com/theos/theos) that provides a few utilities to whatsapp, improving the user experience.  

## Currently Available Features
Currently, BetterW provides 2 (two) options of additional features to use:  
1 - No Read Receipt, that prevents others from seeing when you read a message, but still allowing you to see when others read yours.  
2 - Who Is Online (BETA), that allows you to see who is online, drawing a green or red circle around their profile picture.  
2.1 - As Dot, replaces the Who Is Online indicator with a dot. Who Is Online needs to be enabled.
3 - Confirm Call, that asks you to confirm your desire to call another user, preventing accidental voice / video calls. Also allow for phone calls.  
4 - Don't Delete (BETA), will make so that when someone deletes a message, it does not delete in your device, adding a alert at the top of the message, alerting that the message was saved from oblivion. There is a know issue where sometimes another message can overlap the deleted one, until the app is restarted.  
5 - Global Support, adds whatsapp support to ipad | ipod. Should be enabled in settings.  
6 - No Delete Limit, removing the time limit to delete a message.  
7 - No Online, disabling your online status. Issue: Currently, it also disables your abillity to see who is online. Ussing it disables Who Is Online.  
8 - No Typing, not showing when you are typing but still allowing you to see when others are typing.
